Reliability of Electronic Evidence Diagrams, REEDs, project

Almost all evidence now originates in digital systems or is processed through digital tools. The increasing use of digital evidence has led to the widespread use of tools to facilitate identifying, managing, and disclosing evidence, with the ironic result that evidence is now much more complex than ever before.

Computer evidence used in courts is often problematic, because computers are not reliable and because computers may be managed and operated poorly. Digital forensic standards may not be upheld. The Common Law presumption that computer evidence is reliable is obsolete and encourages miscarriages of justice.

This project, REED, proposes a simple, versatile, visually-based approach to help better understand, communicate, and improve the quality of computer evidence. The approach records and helps highlight and analyze the need for specific evidence, helping critique and improve the quality of what is already thought to be known â€” especially useful for expert witnesses in pre-action discussions. The approach can also help manage IT systems prior to and regardless of possible legal action, and hence help improve the reliability of computer evidence used in any investigations.

This Git repository has the C code of the prototype Unix/Darwin command line tool, reed. This prototype tool was designed to play with the REED idea, and it is very much a flexible prototype so we can reimplement it properly.
