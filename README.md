# A map is worth a thousand words: 
## Reliability of Electronic Evidence Diagrams (REEDs)

Almost all court evidence now originates in digital systems or is processed through digital tools. The increasing use of digital evidence in courts has led to the widespread use of tools to facilitate identifying, managing, and disclosing evidence, with the ironic result that evidence is now much more complex than ever before.

Computer evidence used in courts is often problematic, not just because of complexity but because computers are not reliable and computers may be managed and operated poorly. Digital forensic standards may not be upheld. The Common Law presumption that computer evidence is reliable is obsolete and encourages miscarriages of justice.

This project, **REED**, has built a simple, versatile, visually-based approach to help better understand, communicate, and improve the quality of computer evidence. The approach provides a comprehensive, easy to use map of evidence. REEDs record and help critique and improve the quality of what is already thought to be known â€” they are especially useful for expert witnesses in pre-action discussions. REEDs can also help manage IT systems prior to and regardless of possible legal action, and hence help improve the reliability of computer evidence used in any investigations.

This Git repository has the C code of the ***prototype, explorative*** Unix/Darwin command line tool, reed. This prototype tool was designed to play with the REED idea, and it is very much a flexible prototype so we can reimplement it properly.[^1] 

See [web home page](https://www.harold.thimbleby.net/reeds/) for papers and other resources, including a substantial resource on a large NHS criminal trial, which is used as a case study for using REEDs.

[^1] The next version is going to be written in Rust.
