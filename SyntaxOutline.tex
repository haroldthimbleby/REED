Use Unix command reed (no parameters) to summarise flags

Syntax summary
==============

# comment to end of line!Hash can be used in REED files, and is also used in this syntax summary

### syntax notation...
x ::= y # define non-terminal x to be y
x | y   # x or y
{x}     # grouping in syntax definitions
x+      # at least one x
x++     # at least one x, separated by spaces
[x]     # optional x
        # spaces/blanks can be put between all syntactic items and used freely for layout 

### REED syntax...
id ::= {letter | digit | underline}+ | Cstring | Herestring
Cstring ::= "C string, \\n for newline etc" 
Herestring ::= <<< arbitrary-terminator\n                           characters (no escapes needed) over any number of lines\n                       same-arbitrary-terminator

### narrative strings in notes are translated to HTML and Latex, and can include:
<html> ...  following text is copied to HTML, but skipped in Latex
<latex> ... following text is copied to Latex, but skipped in HTML
<both> ...  following text is mixed basic HTML and Latex (use flag -r to see translation rules)
[[[id]]]!replace with id's name and make a cross-reference link (in both HTML and Latex)

# reserved words can be used as ids if written inside strings
# otherwise, id xyz and string "xyz" are equivalent
# the string notation just allows more characters to be used

### the following are definitions of non-terminals
arrow ::= -> | <- | <->
color ::= black | blue | green | red | white | yellow
id-or-star ::= id | *
node-or-arrow ::= id | id {arrow id}+
node-or-arrow-list ::= node-or-arrow | ( node-or-arrow++ )
document-details ::= abstract | author | date | title

### the following are REED statements
### all terminals below are reserved words
check id1 => id2!Check there is a path from id1 to id2
direction {LR | RL | TB | BT}!Primary direction of graph is left-right, right-left, top-bottom, or bottom-top
document-details id!Specify document details. author id can be used multiple times for multiple authors
group node-or-arrow-list is id!The nodes are grouped, and the group is named
highlight color [cascade] is id!Explain color as id, optionally cascading when it is used
highlight id is color!Highlight node id with color
htmldefinitions id!Insert id at start of <body> in HTML file. htmldefinitions id can be used multiple times
latexdefinitions id!Insert id at start of Latex file. latexdefinitions id can be used multiple times
new style id1 is id2!Define id1 as a style, using Dot syntax for id2 (e.g., "fontcolor=blue;fontsize=18")
node-or-arrow [is id]!Create nodes or arrows, with optional name id
note node-or-arrow-list [is id1 [;]] [author id2 [;]] id3!Provide narrative note id3 for the nodes or arrows, optionally naming them
numbering ( {( id-or-star+ )}++ )!Make node references row.column numbers following the grid layout
ref id1 is id2!Set the reference of node id1 to be id2
rows [TOC] ( {id ( id+ )}++ )!Draw a graph with a structured layout, with optional Theory of Change styling
style node-or-arrow-list is id!Set style of nodes or arrows, either to a named style or to an explicit Dot specification
tags id1 id2!Only process REED code between id1 (begin) and id2 (end) (so needs id2 to stop REED processing)
version id!Subsequent REED code is version id (see flag v=value)

;!semicolons are empty statements, and can be placed freely between statements
override ...!Permit conflicting commands (e.g., title) to override earlier commands (used with version id and flag v=id)
