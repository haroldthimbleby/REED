# comment to end of line!Hash can be used in REED files, and is also used in this syntax summary

### syntax notation...

x ::= y # define non-terminal x to be y
x | y   # x or y
{x}     # bracket in syntax definitions
x+      # at least one x
x++     # at least one x, separated by spaces
[x]     # optional x
        # spaces/blanks can be put between all syntactic items and used freely for layout 

### REED syntax...

id ::= {letter | digit | underline}+ | string
string ::= "C string, \\n for newline etc" | <<< terminator\n                                                        arbitrary-string\n                                                terminator

# reserved words cannot be used as ids unless written inside strings
# id xyz and string "xyz" are equivalent
# the string notation just allows more characters

### the following are definitions of non-terminals

arrow ::= -> | <- | <->
color ::= black | blue | green | red | white | yellow
id-or-star ::= id | *
node-or-arrow ::= id | id {arrow id}+
node-or-arrow-list ::= node-or-arrow | ( node-or-arrow++ )

### the following are REED statements
### all terminals below are reserved words

check id => id!Check there is a path from id1 to id2
direction {LR | RL | TB | BT}!Primary direction of graph is left-right, right-left, top-bottom, or bottom-top
group node-or-arrow-list is id!The nodes are grouped, and the group is named
highlight color [cascade] is id!Explain color as id, optionally cascading when it is used
highlight id is color!Highlight node id with color
htmldefinitions id!Insert id at start of <body> in HTML file
latexdefinitions id!Insert id at start of Latex file
new style id is id!Define id1 as a style, using Dot syntax for id2 (e.g., "fontcolor=blue;fontsize=18")
node-or-arrow [is id]!Create nodes or arrows, with optional name id
note node-or-arrow-list [is id [;]] [author id [;]] id!Provide narrative note for the nodes or arrows, optionally naming them
numbering ( {( id-or-star+ )}++ )!Make node references row.column numbers following the grid layout
[override] {abstract | date | title | version} id!Provide abstract, date, etc. Just once, unless overide
ref id is id!Set the reference of node id1 to be id2
rows [TOC] ( {id ( id+ )}++ )!Draw a graph with a structured layout, with optional Theory of Change styling
style node-or-arrow-list is id!Set style of nodes or arrows, either to explicit Dot style or to a named style
tags id id!Only process REED code between id1 (begin) and id2 (end) (so needs id2 to stop REED processing)

; # semicolons are empty statements, and can be placed between statements
