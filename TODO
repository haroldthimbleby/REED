new notes data structure ...
to handle possible multiple authors

reimplement in Rust!

XML, JSON add keywords

when re-implemented:

stuff like components and pulls need to be run before generating reports, etc creating subgraphs which are then used for generating html latex

maybe allow [[[ a -> b ]]] ???

Haven't implemented -drop x (to complement -pull x) yet
