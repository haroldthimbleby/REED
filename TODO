new notes data structure ...
reimplement in Rust!

XML, JSON add keywords
makefile for betweeness diagram

when re-implemented:

stuff like components and pulls need to be run before generating reports, etc creating subgraphs which are then used for generating html latex

maybe allow [[[ a -> b ]]] ???
