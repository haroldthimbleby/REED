    <note>    	\warn{An Abbott engineer, Mr.\ Reece, had been asked to help when the Princess of Wales PrecisionWeb database faced problems in 2013. Mr.\ Reece then worked unsupervised on the PrecisionWeb database.}
	
	\warn{Reece gave evidence that he had failed to take notes on exactly what he did when editing, deleting, and modifying data in the PrecisionWeb database. He admitted he had deleted critical data, which would have created the impression that nurses had been negligent not performing blood glucose tests.}
	
	\warn{This deletion of computer evidence explains the discrepancy in patient records that the prosecution claims had been wholly and entirely caused by the nurses&apos; criminal negligence.}</note>

    <note>    	The PrecisionWeb data records XceedPro serial numbers, and shows that XceedPros routinely move around the hospital. 
	
	\warn{The PrecisionWeb data confirms that the Police seized all three XceedPros that happened to be on Ward 2 on the date when they visited it. However, the seizure did not include any XceedPros that had been used by the defendants.} 
	
	\warn{Seizing the wrong XceedPros will give the false impression that the XceedPro data  confirms the Prosecution&apos;s contention that the nurses&apos;s fabricated meter readings. The seized XceedPros were checked as reliable by Abbott (node [[[17]]]) --- that is, Abbott unsurprisingly confirms their XceedPros work as they expect, not that they checked the \emph{right\/} XceedPros.}

	&lt;latex&gt;Reference \cite{POW} explains how the Police came to seize the wrong XceedPros.

    <note>    	The US company Abbott manufactured the XceedPros and the PrecisionWeb database, both critical components of this case.

	The Police sent the wrong 3 XceedPros to Abbott to determine if they worked correctly. The Abbott labs found no relevant problems with the XceedPros, but they did confirm that all XceedPros had bugs.

	However, none of the bugs Abbott described would affect or cause loss of data, unless the XceedPros had been used to try to record over 2,500 tests, which is considerably higher than any XceedPro at the Princess of Wales had ever recorded (at least as established by the Police&apos;s PrecisionWeb evidence).</note>

    <note>    	The nurse takes an XceedPro to a patient, and they must then tap the XceedPro with their ID card, then scan the patient&apos;s ID card. Then the patient is pricked to obtain a small blood sample, which is inserted into the XceedPro. The XceedPro records the IDs, the date and time, and the blood glucose level. Nurses may share ID cards, or they may ``double tap&apos;&apos; and use their ID card twice instead of using the patient&apos;s ID card.

	Although there were opportunities for the Police to collect incorrect or incomplete evidence, or to corrupt the evidence that they had collected, there is no nothing to suggest that the Police checked their final computer evidence against the original hospital sources. The police process took no precautions to detect or mitigate the effect of possible cyberattack (or other database problems, such as hardware faults, system crashes --- which were known to occur --- or operator error), such as comparing their collected data with backups. 

	Although the Police used Excel to manage the evidence (which can delete data, columns and rows, etc, without leaving any record of changes) there is no record to show that they checked their final evidence against the original data.

    <note>    	\warn{The Police used PrecisionWeb unsupervised, exported data to CSV format.}\footnote{Hospital policy has since been revised.}

	The Police certainly examined the PrecisionWeb data in Excel, as their written evidence says their first attempts crashed Excel (presumably because of the size of the Excel spreadsheet). I do not understand why the Police did not use SQL (or any other decent database), as they could simply have copied the SQL PrecisionWeb database rather than relying on PrecisionWeb to convert it to CSV\@.

	\warn{CSV is a \emph{very\/} unsuitable data format to choose for evidence, as there is no way to detect edited, deleted, or inserted data.}

	Whatever CSV data they selected, they copied to a USB stick. This stick was then taken by car to a Police forensic environment, and copied to an encrypted secure disk drive. Subsequently, unencrypted CDs were burned from the files on the secure disc.

	The Police evidence claimed their process was forensic --- but it was only forensic \emph{after\/} copying CSV data to the secure disk drive, and provided that no Police staff with password access modified the data.</note>
