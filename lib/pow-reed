	The PrecisionWeb manual warns that it is not designed for clinical use. Nevertheless the Princess of Wales hospital used PrecisionWeb for clinical purposes.

	\warn{No evidence of the reliability of Conworx and other middleware (for example, hospital test results, or manufacturer claims of reliability) has been mentioned in evidence.}
	
	\warn{The hospital refused access to technicians, which meant we have no idea of or the extent of the middleware or how it is supposed to work.}

	\warn{The police visited the hospital and exported CSV data from the hospital's PrecisionWeb database to an unencrypted USB stick, a process that is insecure.}

	Although there were opportunities for the police to collect incorrect or incomplete evidence, or to corrupt the evidence that they had collected, there is no nothing to suggest that the police checked their final computer evidence against the original hospital sources. The police process took no precautions to detect or mitigate the effect of possible cyberattack (or other database problems, such as hardware faults, system crashes --- which were known to occur --- or operator error), such as comparing their collected data with backups. 

	Although the police used Excel to manage the evidence (which can delete data, columns and rows, etc, without leaving any record of changes) there is no record to show that they checked their final evidence against the original data. 

	\warn{The final evidence was presented to the court on both encrypted CDs and USB sticks \emph{and was explicitly claimed to be forensic quality evidence}.}
ENDNOTE

highlight 11 is red
keywords "PrecisionWeb database" CSV
note 11 is "Police forensic\ndatabase system" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{The police used PrecisionWeb unsupervised, exported data to CSV format.}\footnote{Hospital policy has since been revised.}

	The police certainly examined the PrecisionWeb data in Excel, as their written evidence says their first attempts crashed Excel (presumably because of the size of the Excel spreadsheet). I do not understand why the police did not use SQL (or any other decent database), as they could simply have copied the SQL PrecisionWeb database rather than relying on PrecisionWeb to convert it to CSV\@.

	\warn{CSV is a \emph{very\/} unsuitable data format to choose for evidence, as there is no way to detect edited, deleted, or inserted data.}

	Whatever CSV data they selected, they copied to a USB stick. This stick was then taken by car to a police forensic environment, and copied to an encrypted secure disk drive. Subsequently, unencrypted CDs were burned from the files on the secure disc.

	The police evidence claimed their process was forensic --- but it was only forensic \emph{after\/} copying CSV data to the secure disk drive, and provided that no police staff with password access modified the data.

	\warn{In addition to mistakenly seizing the wrong XceedPros, the police sent them to Abbott (node [[[to:17]]]) to be checked for reliability. Abbott unsurprisingly confirmed the XceedPros worked correctly --- it would have been better to chose an independent organization to check the XceedPros.}

\warn{Furthermore, Abbott's evidence says nothing about the reliability of the XceedPros \emph{actually\/}  used by the nurses. Checking the wrong XceedPros is irrelevant to the Prosecution's contention that the nurses fabricated meter readings.}

	The US company Abbott manufactured the XceedPros and the PrecisionWeb database, both critical components of this case.

	The police sent the 3 seized XceedPros to Abbott to determine if they worked correctly. It is surprising the police chose Abbott themselves to check the XceedPros, as Abbott have a vested interest in saying their own products are reliable. Moreover, the police sent the wrong XceedPros to Abbott, as they had seized the glucometers on the ward when they visited, not the glucometers that the nurses had originally used.
	
	The Abbott labs found no relevant problems with the XceedPros, but they did confirm that all XceedPros had bugs.

	However, none of the bugs Abbott described would affect or cause loss of data, unless the XceedPros had been used to try to record over 2,500 tests, which is considerably higher than any XceedPro at the Princess of Wales had ever recorded (at least as established by the police's PrecisionWeb evidence).
