note 7<->8 is "?" <<< ENDNOTE
Arrows marked ``\textbf{?}'' indicate evidence flows that we \emph{should\/} know about, but no relevant information has been made available, despite requests. We think the evidence probably does not exist because (we surmise that) the IT operators probably did not do the appropriate work, such as testing (see [[[14]]]).

group (4 5 6 7 8 9) is hospital
group (16 17 18) is xceedpro

note 1 is "Defendant\nnurses\non Ward 2" <<< ENDNOTE
	The defendants were named, and provided witness statements.
ENDNOTE

highlight 2 is white
note 2 is Patients <<< ENDNOTE
	The patients on Ward 2 had limited capacity.
ENDNOTE

highlight 3 is white
note 3 is "Nurse-written\npaper records\n(never disclosed)" <<< ENDNOTE
	Contemporaneously with treating patients, nurses should review the XceedPro they have used and copy its data to paper notes. The Police never provided the nurse-written records. 

	\warn{The XceedPro can record up to 2,500 patient records and then it will start overwriting records. As I never had access to the relevant XceedPros, I do not know whether this bug was relevant: had an XceedPro recorded about 2,500 records it \emph{could\/} have given the impression the nurse had not performed tests the nurse had documented on paper notes.}
ENDNOTE

highlight 4 is white
note 4 is "XceedPros\non Ward 2" <<< ENDNOTE
	The nurse takes an XceedPro to a patient, and they must then tap the XceedPro with their ID card, then scan the patient's ID card. Then the patient is pricked to obtain a small blood sample, which is inserted into the XceedPro. The XceedPro records the IDs, the date and time, and the blood glucose level. Nurses may share ID cards, or they may ``double tap'' and use their ID card twice instead of using the patient's ID card. 
	
	See node [[[17]]]: \warn{Manufacturer evidence says XceedPros have numerous bugs; however none of the documented bugs lose patient data.}
ENDNOTE

highlight 5 is white
note 5 is "XceedPro\ndock\non ward" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{No evidence of the reliability of the XceedPro dock (for example, hospital test results, or manufacturer claims of reliability, or even daily checks of integrity) has been offered. Its reliable use depends on hospital network reliability, and no evidence of the reliability of the hospital network has been offered. The network may have had outages during the relevant period.}
ENDNOTE

highlight 6 is white
note 6 is "Ward PCs" <<< ENDNOTE
	The ward has PCs where nurses can review patient information. 
	
	\warn{It is not clear whether nurses can edit data, for instance in case two patients were mixed up with the XceedPros (e.g., by putting the wrong test strip in or using one with a second patient) --- and if so, whether edits must be done by the nurse (or person with the same ID) who originally took the readings.}
	
	\warn{We do not know who had access to the Ward PCs (whether nurses or hospital operators).}
ENDNOTE

#highlight 7 is blue
note 7 is "Abbott\nPrecisionWeb\ndatabase" <<< ENDNOTE
	PrecisionWeb is a proprietary database designed to monitor XceedPros, such as their battery health. 
	
	PrecisionWeb manual warns that it is not designed for clinical use, but the Princess of Wales hospital used it clinically --- the blood glucose readings (amongst other data) are copied, via middleware (node [[[8]]]) to the main hospital database. \warn{It is therefore not clear that PrecisionWeb is reliable enough to present patient data as evidence.}
ENDNOTE

manual->7
note manual is "PrecisionWeb\noperators\nmanual" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{The operators manual for PrecisionWeb says it should not be used for clinical purposes. All the evidence for this case assumed the clinical records in PrecisionWeb were reliable.}
ENDNOTE

highlight 8 is yellow
note 8 is "Lots of unknown\ncomplex middleware" <<< ENDNOTE
	PrecisionWeb (node [[[7]]]) is not interoperable with other hospital systems, so middleware Conworx is used to interface PrecisionWeb to the main patient databases.
	
	\warn{No evidence of the reliability of Conworx and other middleware (for example, hospital test results, or manufacturer claims of reliability) has been mentioned in evidence.}
	
	\warn{The hospital refused access to technicians, which meant we have no idea of or the extent of the middleware or how it is supposed to work.}
	
	\warn{Such complex multi-manufacturer systems will have bugs, so it is very surprising not to have error logs (etc) presented in routine statements.}
ENDNOTE

highlight 9 is yellow
note 9 is "Main hospital\ndatabases" <<< ENDNOTE
	The hospital databases are managed by hospital technicians. None provided evidence statements, and none were called to give evidence.

	\warn{Such complex systems will have bugs, so it is very surprising not to have error logs (etc) presented in routine statements.}

	\warn{It is curious that the discrepancies were originally discovered from the main hospital databases, not from PrecisionWeb. The Police never took evidence from the main hospital databases.}
ENDNOTE

highlight 10 is red 
note 10 is "Frequent crashes\ndocumented" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{Evidence revealed in court was that the PrecisionWeb database (or the server it ran on) frequently crashed. The evidence said nothing about the impact of crashes on the integrity of the database; presumably at least the transactions pending when crashes happened would be lost.}
ENDNOTE

highlight forensicProblems is yellow
forensicProblems -> 11
note forensicProblems is "No evidence to\nsupport reliability\nof forensic methods" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{The Police visited the hospital and exported CSV data from the hospital's PrecisionWeb database to an unencrypted USB stick, a process that is insecure.}

	Although there were opportunities for the Police to collect incorrect or incomplete evidence, or to corrupt the evidence that they had collected, there is no nothing to suggest that the Police checked their final computer evidence against the original hospital sources. The police process took no precautions to detect or mitigate the effect of possible cyberattack (or other database problems, such as hardware faults, system crashes --- which were known to occur --- or operator error), such as comparing their collected data with backups. 

	Although the Police used Excel to manage the evidence (which can delete data, columns and rows, etc, without leaving any record of changes) there is no record to show that they checked their final evidence against the original data. 

	\warn{The final evidence was presented to the court on both encrypted CDs and USB sticks \emph{and was explicitly claimed to be forensic quality evidence}.}
ENDNOTE

highlight 11 is red
note 11 is "Police forensic\ndatabase system" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{The Police used PrecisionWeb unsupervised, exported data to CSV format.}\footnote{Hospital policy has since been revised.}

	The Police certainly examined the PrecisionWeb data in Excel, as their written evidence says their first attempts crashed Excel (presumably because of the size of the Excel spreadsheet). I do not understand why the Police did not use SQL (or any other decent database), as they could simply have copied the SQL PrecisionWeb database rather than relying on PrecisionWeb to convert it to CSV\@.

	\warn{CSV is a \emph{very\/} unsuitable data format to choose for evidence, as there is no way to detect edited, deleted, or inserted data.}

	Whatever CSV data they selected, they copied to a USB stick. This stick was then taken by car to a Police forensic environment, and copied to an encrypted secure disk drive. Subsequently, unencrypted CDs were burned from the files on the secure disc.

	The Police evidence claimed their process was forensic --- but it was only forensic \emph{after\/} copying CSV data to the secure disk drive, and provided that no Police staff with password access modified the data.
ENDNOTE

highlight 12 is red
note 12 is "Main Police evidence" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{A joint prosecution/defence expert witness report (``Experts' Joint Statement on Matters Agreed and/or Disagreed in regard to Part 35 12 (3) CPR'') lists many problems, including that the CDs CH/15 the Police provided to the prosecution and defence experts were different, raising serious questions of Police forensic process \cite{POW-resources}.}

Refer to node [[[11]]]. 
ENDNOTE

highlight 13 is white
note 13 is "Hospital\ncomputer\noperators" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{We have no idea what the hospital computer system operators did, how they were managed, or what their security protocols (if any) were.}

	Note how (using Statechart conventions for diagrams) a \emph{single\/} arrow from node [[[13]]]) to the group [[[hospital]]] is sufficient to show that computer operators affect \emph{all\/} nodes inside the box.\footnote{Statecharts, invented by David Harel, are well-known diagrams widely used in computer science.}
ENDNOTE

highlight 14 is yellow
note 14 is "No evidence\nof any testing\never performed" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{The hospital presented no evidence that it knew that any of its systems were reliable. However, the hospital did present evidence that PrecisionWeb regularly crashes (node [[[10]]]).}
ENDNOTE

highlight 15 is yellow
note 15 is "No evidence of\nerror logs\nor audits" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{It is astonishing there is no evidence that the hospital ever checked whether their computer systems were functioning normally.}

	\warn{It is also astonishing the Police recorded data from hospital systems without confirming the reliability of the data, and did so without hospital supervision.}
ENDNOTE

highlight 16 is red
note 16 is "Wrong XceedPros\nseized by Police" <<< ENDNOTE
	The PrecisionWeb data records XceedPro serial numbers, and shows that XceedPros routinely move around the hospital. 
	
	\warn{The PrecisionWeb data confirms that the Police seized all three XceedPros that happened to be on Ward 2 on the date when they visited it. However, the seizure did not include any XceedPros that had been used by the defendants.} 
	
	\warn{Seizing the wrong XceedPros will give the false impression that the XceedPro data  confirms the Prosecution's contention that the nurses's fabricated meter readings. The seized XceedPros were checked as reliable by Abbott (node [[[17]]]) --- that is, Abbott unsurprisingly confirms their XceedPros work as they expect, not that they checked the \emph{right\/} XceedPros.}

	<latex>Reference \cite{POW} explains how the Police came to seize the wrong XceedPros.
	<html>The <a href="https://harold.thimbleby.net/reeds">REED paper</a> explains how the Police came to seize the wrong XceedPros.
ENDNOTE

note 17 is "Abbott\nlabs" <<< ENDNOTE
	The US company Abbott manufactured the XceedPros and the PrecisionWeb database, both critical components of this case.

	The Police sent the wrong 3 XceedPros to Abbott to determine if they worked correctly. The Abbott labs found no relevant problems with the XceedPros, but they did confirm that all XceedPros had bugs.

	However, none of the bugs Abbott described would affect or cause loss of data, unless the XceedPros had been used to try to record over 2,500 tests, which is considerably higher than any XceedPro at the Princess of Wales had ever recorded (at least as established by the Police's PrecisionWeb evidence).
ENDNOTE

highlight 18 is red
note 18 is "Police summary\nof wrong XceedPro\nevidence" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{Because of the problems noted under node [[[16]]], this evidence was excluded.}
ENDNOTE

note hospital is "Hospital IT Systems" <<< ENDNOTE
	\warn{We know nothing about the management of the hospital systems and any impact on the evidence.} \warn{In a hospital (or any other critical environment) one would expect at least daily checks of reliable performance or error logs. The REED diagram shows there were no such checks.}
ENDNOTE

note xceedpro is "XceedPro evidence" <<< ENDNOTE
The Police examined the wrong XceedPros. The evidence presented on XceedPros is not relevant to the case.

	\warn{Nick Reece, a PrecisionWeb support Specialist employed by Abbott Diabetes Care, had been asked by the hospital to help when the Princess of Wales PrecisionWeb database faced problems in 2013. Mr.\ Reece then worked unsupervised on the PrecisionWeb database, apparently taking no notes and certainly not following any forensic process.}


	Reece gave evidence that he had failed to take notes on exactly what he did when editing, deleting, and modifying data in the PrecisionWeb database. He admitted he had deleted critical data, which would have created the impression that nurses had been negligent not performing blood glucose tests.
	
	\warn{This deletion of computer evidence explains the discrereed pancy in patient records that the prosecution claims had been wholly and entirely caused by the nurses' criminal negligence.}
